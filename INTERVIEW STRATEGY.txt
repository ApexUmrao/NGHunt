INTERVIEW STRATEGY


Connect Tech to Outcomes:
"I used [Tech] to solve [Problem], achieving [Result]."
Example: "Hibernate caching reduced DB load by 40%."

Highlight Versatility:
"I chose PostgreSQL for geospatial needs vs. Oracle for financial transactions."

Show Evolution:
"Moved from SVN → Git for better branching, and JBoss → Spring Boot for faster boot times."

Ask Insightful Questions:
"How do you balance microservice independence vs. DRY principles here?"



1. Languages

Java SE/EE:
Use Case: Developed core backend logic for an e-commerce payment gateway (Java EE). Used Java SE for multithreaded batch processing of 10K+ daily transactions.
Why? Platform independence, robustness, and concurrency utilities (CompletableFuture).

JavaScript:
Use Case: Built dynamic admin dashboards (React.js) to monitor real-time payment success/failure rates.
Why? Frontend interactivity without full page reloads.






2. Frameworks & Libraries

Spring Boot:
Use Case: Created RESTful microservices for user authentication and order processing.
Why? Auto-configuration, embedded Tomcat, and dependency management.

Spring MVC:
Use Case: Legacy monolith migration – used @Controller and DispatcherServlet to handle HTTP requests for order tracking.

Hibernate/JPA:
Use Case: Managed customer data across Oracle and PostgreSQL DBs. Used @OneToMany mapping for User→Orders relationships.
Optimization: Lazy loading + @EntityGraph to fix N+1 queries.

RESTful APIs:
Use Case: Designed stateless APIs for mobile/web clients. Example:





3. Databases

Oracle:
Use Case: Chose for ACID-compliant financial transactions (e.g., payment settlements).
Key Feature: PL/SQL for complex server-side logic.

MySQL:
Use Case: User profile management (high read-volume). Optimized with indexes and replication.

PostgreSQL:
Use Case: Geospatial queries for store locator microservice (using PostGIS extension).






4. Servers & Deployment

Tomcat/JBoss/WebSphere:
Use Case:

Tomcat: Default for Spring Boot WAR deployments.

JBoss: Used for EJB-heavy legacy modules.

WebSphere: Enterprise SSO integration.

Maven:
Use Case: Managed dependencies (e.g., Spring, Hibernate) and built artifacts via mvn clean package.

Jenkins & CI/CD:
Use Case: Automated pipeline:


Docker:
Use Case: Containerized microservices for consistent environments (Dev to Prod).





5. Version Control & Tools

Git/GitLab:
Use Case: Feature branching + merge requests for collaborative development.
Example: git rebase to keep master history clean.

SVN:
Use Case: Maintained legacy projects (phased out post-2022).

JIRA:
Use Case: Managed Agile sprints – user stories, backlog grooming, and bug tracking.






6. Testing

JUnit & Mockito:
Use Case:

Unit-tested payment validation logic.

Mocked PaymentGatewayService to test failure scenarios.

Postman:
Use Case: Automated API testing (e.g., 200+ endpoints for smoke testing).

SoapUI:
Use Case: Tested SOAP-based integrations with legacy banking systems.








7. Other Skills

Microservices:
Use Case: Decomposed monolith into 6 microservices (Spring Boot + Docker).
Challenge: Service discovery → Solution: Netflix Eureka.

Agile/Scrum:
Use Case: Bi-weekly sprints with cross-functional teams. Led daily standups as Scrum Master.

AWS S3:
Use Case: Stored user-uploaded documents (e.g., invoices).
Integration: Spring Boot + AWS SDK for direct uploads.
